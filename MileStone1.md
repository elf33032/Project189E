Our app will have a login controller, authentication controller, main controller which contains map and users, chat view controller, two types of pop-ups, and a setting view controller.  
The navigation order is login -> authentication -> main and it cannot turn back. from the main view controller, we can either navigate to the setting view controller or chat view controller and can turn back to the main view controller.

## Testing Plan
we will invite our friends and classmates to test our app, and measure test result based on survey data. There might be some parts of features which will need more tests. For example, we wanted to store the chatting history of users. If we decided to stored them remotely on the server, we need to test the query time when the chatting history is really large
